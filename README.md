# LyftDS

Work done so far:

Converted meters to miles

Converted seconds to minutes

Calculated cost of ride using only miles or using only minutes

Changed all values <5 or >400 to minimum cost (5) and maximum cost (400)

Counted how many rides driver_id has done

Joined driver_id with date joined

Questions:

How is the fare calculated; the minute/mile fare is vastly different.

Does service fee and base fee count into minimum fee?
